    -> innkeeper

= cards
The card game is in full swing, with everybody engaged in every hand. Some money is being exchanged but you really can't figure out what game is being played. One of the players is eying you and you have the impression its better to leave the players at their game.

    * {open_gate} [Ring Bell]
        The bell makes a very broken sound and at first nothing happens but after a pause of a few seconds suddenly the bell grows to human size and plants itself right in front of you. It's ready for a tussle. 
            -> END
    * [Walk around the house]
        You spend some time looking around the house but there is a thick thorny hedge surrounding it and you really don't want to break any of the widnows.
